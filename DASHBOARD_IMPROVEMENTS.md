# Dashboard Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Content Being Cut Off at Top
**Problem:** Dashboard content was being cut off due to overflow constraints
**Solution:** 
- Removed `overflow-hidden` from main container
- Changed content wrapper from `h-full` to `min-h-full`
- Added proper `overflow-y-auto` for scrolling

### 2. ✅ Sidebar Border Not Stretching to Bottom
**Problem:** Sidebar wasn't stretching to full viewport height
**Solution:**
- Changed sidebar from `h-full` to `h-screen`
- Added `sticky top-0` to keep sidebar fixed while scrolling
- Sidebar now stays full height with proper border
