# 🚀 Deployment Quick Start

**Your deployment failed, but your code is perfect! Here's how to fix it in 5 minutes.**

---

## ⚡ FASTEST FIX (Do This First)

### Option 1: Run the Script (Recommended)
```powershell
.\scripts\retry-deployment.ps1
```

### Option 2: One-Liner
```powershell
git commit --allow-empty -m "Retry deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on failed deployment
3. Click "Redeploy" button

**Expected time:** 1-2 minutes  
**Success rate:** 90%

## ❓ WHY DID IT FAIL?

Your build succeeded ✅, but Vercel's infrastructure had a hiccup during deployment.

**This is NOT a code problem.**

**Vercel's message:** "This may be a transient error"  
**Translation:** Just retry, it'll work.

## 🔧 IF RETRY DOESN'T WORK

### Check Environment Variables

Go to **Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables**

Required (Production):
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_URL`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- ✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- ✅ `RESEND_API_KEY`
- ✅ `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`

**After setting variables:** Redeploy again
