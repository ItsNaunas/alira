# üî¥ Deployment Failed Twice - Advanced Troubleshooting

**Status:** Retry didn't work - Let's fix this properly  
**Updated:** October 20, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## üìã WHAT WE KNOW

‚úÖ **Build succeeds** (all 29 pages generated)  
‚úÖ **TypeScript passes**  
‚úÖ **Linting passes**  
‚ùå **Deployment fails** at "Deploying outputs" stage  
‚ùå **Retry also failed** - Not a transient error

---

## üéØ MOST LIKELY CAUSES (In Order)

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Environment Variables (70% Probability)

This is the **#1 cause** of persistent deployment failures.

**Action Required:**

#### A. Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your ALIRA project
3. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**

#### B. Verify EVERY Variable Is Set:

**Critical Variables (Must have ALL):**

Production Environment:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=contact@alirapartners.co.uk
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes:**
- Typo in variable name (e.g., `SUPABASE_UR` instead of `SUPABASE_URL`)
- Incomplete JWT token (truncated copy-paste)
- Wrong environment scope (service key in Preview)
- Using development values in production

#### C. How to Get Each Value:

**Supabase Keys:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Settings ‚Üí API
4. Copy:
   - **Project URL** ‚Üí Both `SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **anon public** ‚Üí Both `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - **service_role** ‚Üí `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (Production ONLY!)

**OpenAI Key:**
1. Go to platform.openai.com
2. API Keys section
3. Copy key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)

**Resend Keys:**
1. Go to resend.com/dashboard
2. API Keys section
3. Copy key (starts with `re_...`)
4. Domains ‚Üí Verify your domain for `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`

#### D. After Setting Variables:

```powershell
# Trigger new deployment
git commit --allow-empty -m "Apply environment variables"
git push origin main
```

**Expected:** Deployment should succeed if this was the issue

---

### 2. üö´ Vercel Account/Billing Issues (15% Probability)

**Check Your Vercel Account:**

#### A. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Usage

Look for:
- ‚ùå Bandwidth exceeded
- ‚ùå Build minutes exhausted
- ‚ùå Function executions limit reached
- ‚ùå Payment method declined
- ‚ùå Plan upgrade required

#### B. Check for Yellow/Red Warnings

If you see warnings:
- **Upgrade plan** if limits exceeded
- **Add payment method** if required
- **Wait for reset** (monthly limits)

#### C. Check Vercel Status

Visit: https://www.vercel-status.com

If there's an ongoing incident:
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Wait for resolution
- üîÑ Retry after status is green

---

### 3. üì¶ Output Size Issues (10% Probability)

Your build output might exceed Vercel's limits.

**Vercel Free Tier Limits:**
- Function size: 50 MB compressed
- Total deployment: 100 MB

**Check Your Build:**

```powershell
# Check build size
npm run build
```

Look at the output table. If any route shows **> 500 KB First Load JS**, you might have issues.

**Your Current Status:**
- Largest route: 221 kB ‚úÖ (within limits)
- Middleware: 67.5 kB ‚úÖ (within limits)

**Verdict:** Size should be fine, but let's optimize just in case.

---

### 4. üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Issues (5% Probability)

**I've created an optimized `vercel.json` for you:**

This file:
- Sets proper memory limits
- Configures timeouts
- Optimizes region selection
- Uses proper install command

**After committing:**

```powershell
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Add Vercel configuration"
git push origin main
```

   - Check for typos
   - Ensure values are complete

5. **Redeploy:**
   ```powershell
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Configured environment variables"
   git push origin main
   ```

6. **Wait & Watch:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
   - Watch the build progress
   - Should succeed in 1-2 minutes

**Result:** If this was the issue ‚Üí ‚úÖ Success!

---

### **STEP 2: If Still Failing - Check Logs**

1. **Go to Failed Deployment:**
   - Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
   - Click on the failed deployment

2. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Look for error messages
   - Check for missing imports
   - Look for API key errors

3. **Check Runtime Logs:**
   - Click "Functions" tab
   - Check for function errors

4. **Take Screenshot:**

   - We'll need this for support

---

### **STEP 3: Clear Cache & Force Redeploy**

1. **Clear Build Cache:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Build & Development Settings
   - Scroll to bottom

   - Select "Use existing build cache: NO"
   - Click "Redeploy"

---

### **STEP 4: Alternative Deployment Methods**

If Vercel continues to fail, try:

#### Option A: Vercel CLI
```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

#### Option B: Different Platform

**Netlify:**
```powershell
# Install Netlify CLI
npm i -g netlify-cli

# Login
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --build
```

**Cloudflare Pages:**
- Connect GitHub repo
- Configure build: `npm run build`
- Output: `.next`
- Deploy
