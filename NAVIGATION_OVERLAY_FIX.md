# Navigation Overlay Fix - Root Cause Analysis

## The Problem

The dashboard content was being cut off at the top because the **global Header component** was overlaying the dashboard content.

## Root Cause

In `app/layout.tsx`, there was a global `Header` component being rendered on **ALL pages**:

```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
  <Header />  // This was rendering on dashboard too!
  <main className="flex-1">
    {children}
  </main>
  <Footer />
</div>
```

The `Header` component has:
```tsx
<header className="fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50">
```

This **fixed positioning with z-50** was covering the top of the dashboard content, which has its own sidebar navigation system.

## The Solution

### Created Conditional Layout System

1. **Created `components/ConditionalLayout.tsx`** - A client component that checks the current route and conditionally renders the Header/Footer

```tsx
'use client'

export default function ConditionalLayout({ children }) {
  const pathname = usePathname()
  
  // Pages with their own navigation (sidebar)
  const pagesWithOwnNav = ['/dashboard', '/form', '/form-chat']
  const shouldShowHeaderFooter = !pagesWithOwnNav.some(path => pathname?.startsWith(path))

  if (!shouldShowHeaderFooter) {
    return <>{children}</>  // No Header/Footer for dashboard/form
  }

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col">
      <Header />
      <main className="flex-1">{children}</main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  )
}
```

2. **Updated `app/layout.tsx`** - Kept as server component for metadata, uses ConditionalLayout for dynamic header/footer

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en-GB" className="scroll-smooth dark">
      <body className="antialiased">
        <ErrorBoundary>
          <ConditionalLayout>
            {children}
          </ConditionalLayout>
        </ErrorBoundary>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## Why This Approach?

1. ✅ **Metadata Export** - Root layout stays as server component, can export metadata
2. ✅ **Conditional Rendering** - Client component uses `usePathname()` to detect route
3. ✅ **Clean Separation** - Dashboard/Form pages have sidebar navigation
4. ✅ **Global Nav** - Other pages (home, about, services, etc.) keep Header/Footer
5. ✅ **No Overlay** - Dashboard content renders from top without obstruction

## Pages Affected

### With Sidebar Navigation (No Header/Footer):
- `/dashboard` - Has DashboardLayout with sidebar
- `/form` - Has FormLayout with sidebar  
- `/form-chat` - Has its own layout

### With Global Header/Footer:
- `/` - Homepage
- `/about` - About page
- `/services` - Services page
- `/contact` - Contact page
- `/how-it-works` - How it works
- `/results` - Results page
- All other pages

## Technical Details

- **No TypeScript errors** ✅
- **No linter warnings** ✅
- **Server/Client split** properly maintained ✅
- **Metadata generation** works correctly ✅
- **Dynamic routing** handled properly ✅

## Result

✅ Dashboard content now renders from the very top
✅ No more overlapping navigation
✅ Sidebar stretches full height with proper border
✅ Other pages keep their original Header/Footer
✅ Clean, maintainable solution
