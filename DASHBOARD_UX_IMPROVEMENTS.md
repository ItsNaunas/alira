# Dashboard UX Improvements

**Date:** October 20, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Strategic Plan Box Improvements ✅

**Problem:** The "Your Strategic Plan" box was too large with just an icon, not showing any preview of the actual content.

**Solution:**
- Reduced box height from `aspect-[8.5/11]` (tall portrait) to `h-48` (fixed compact height)
- Added text preview showing:
  - Problem Statement excerpt (2 lines)
  - Key Objectives excerpt (3 lines)
- Added hover effect with "Click to View Full Plan" overlay
- Made entire card clickable for better UX
- Improved visual hierarchy with gold accents for section labels

### 2. Next Steps Box Improvements ✅

**Problem:** The "Next Steps" box was too large and didn't show enough steps at once.

**Solution:**
- Fixed height at `h-48` to match Strategic Plan box
- Shows up to 5 next steps (previously 3)
- Added scrollable overflow with custom scrollbar styling
- Truncates long steps at 120 characters for readability
- Added "View all X steps →" link when there are more than 5 steps
- Improved spacing and visual consistency

### 3. PDF Download Functionality Fix ✅

**Problem:** PDF download wasn't working, likely due to storage bucket issues.

**Solution:**

#### Backend (API Route):
- Added graceful fallback when storage upload fails
- Now returns PDF as base64 if storage isn't available
- Better error handling and logging
- Won't fail completely if storage is misconfigured

#### Frontend (PlanHeader Component):
- Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages
- Added support for both URL and base64 PDF responses
- Implements direct browser download for base64 PDFs
- Creates properly named PDF files: `Business-Name-YYYY-MM-DD.pdf`
- Uses Blob API for efficient file handling

### 4. Visual Consistency ✅

Both boxes now:
- Have the same compact height (`h-48`)
- Maintain proper spacing and padding
- Use consistent typography and color scheme
- Fit properly within the page layout
- Provide better visual hierarchy

## Technical Details

1. **app/dashboard/page.tsx** (Lines 316-439)
   - Replaced large aspect-ratio boxes with fixed height boxes
   - Added text preview for Strategic Plan
   - Made Strategic Plan card clickable

2. Verify text previews show correctly for different plan lengths
3. Check hover effects and interactions
4. Test on mobile devices for responsive behavior
5. Verify scrolling works properly in Next Steps box with many items

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
