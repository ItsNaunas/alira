## ‚ùå Still Getting Errors?

**Solution:** Migration didn't run successfully
- Check for SQL syntax errors in Supabase logs
- Make sure you copied the entire migration file
- Try running it again

### Error: "permission denied"
**Solution:** Using wrong Supabase key
- Check `.env.local` has correct `SUPABASE_URL` and keys
- Make sure you have `NEXT_PUBLIC_` versions too

### Error: "JWT expired" or "Invalid token"
**Solution:** Session issue
- Clear browser cookies
- Log out and log in again
- Check middleware is running
