## Data Fields Mapping

### Conversational Form ‚Üí Database

| Form Field | Database Column | Table |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| business_idea | business_name | dashboards |
| current_challenges | current_challenges | dashboards |
| immediate_goals | immediate_goals | dashboards |
| service_interest | service_interest | dashboards |
| current_tools | current_tools | dashboards |
| *all fields* | form_data | dashboards |
| AI output | content | generations |

---

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Error: "column current_challenges does not exist"
**Solution:** Migration didn't run
- Double-check you ran 003_integrate_existing_schema.sql
- Verify in Supabase: Table Editor ‚Üí dashboards ‚Üí should see new columns

### ‚ùå Error: "permission denied for table dashboards"
**Solution:** RLS policies issue
- Migration creates policies automatically
- Check: Database ‚Üí Policies ‚Üí should see "Users can view own dashboards"

### ‚ùå Error: "relation profiles does not exist"
**Solution:** Your schema might not be set up yet
- Make sure your original schema is deployed
- Check Table Editor shows: profiles, dashboards, generations

### ‚úÖ Success Signs:

Console shows:
```
‚úÖ Saved to database: {id: "uuid", business_name: "...", ...}
```

Dashboard shows your plan ‚úÖ

## üéâ You're Done!

Your conversational form is now fully integrated with your existing database schema. All data flows into your tables, credits system is ready, and everything is secure with RLS policies.

**Test it now:** http://localhost:3002/

## Optional: Clean Up

If you want to remove the old migration files we created earlier:
- `db/migrations/002_add_auth.sql` - Not needed anymore (replaced by 003)
- Keep everything else!

The old `intake_forms` and `business_cases` tables can be ignored - we're using your existing schema instead.
