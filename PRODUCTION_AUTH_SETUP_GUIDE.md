# Production Authentication Setup Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide will walk you through fixing the authentication email redirect issue and ensuring successful deployment.

## ‚úÖ What We've Already Fixed

1. ‚úÖ **Fixed Build Errors** - Corrected `GradientBars` import statements in 4 files
2. ‚úÖ **Created Auth Callback Route** - Added `app/auth/callback/route.ts` to handle Supabase redirects
3. ‚úÖ **Updated Environment Variables Template** - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to `env.example`

## üöÄ What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Add Environment Variable to Vercel

**This is the CRITICAL step to fix email links pointing to localhost**

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your Alira project
3. Click on **Settings** in the top navigation
4. Click on **Environment Variables** in the left sidebar
5. Add a new environment variable:
   - **Key:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
   - **Value:** Your production URL (e.g., `https://alira.vercel.app` or your custom domain)
   - **Environment:** Select **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development**
6. Click **Save**

**Important Notes:**
- Make sure to include `https://` in the URL
- Don't include a trailing slash
- Example: `https://alira-website-git-main-yourname.vercel.app`

### Step 2: Update Supabase Redirect URLs

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **URL Configuration**
4. Update the following settings:

   **Site URL:**
   ```
   https://your-production-domain.com
   ```

   **Redirect URLs:** Add these URLs (one per line):
   ```
   https://your-production-domain.com/auth/callback
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   https://*.vercel.app/auth/callback
   ```

5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Redeploy Your Application

After adding the environment variable, you need to trigger a new deployment:

**Option A: Via Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click the **...** menu on the latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**
4. Make sure **Use existing Build Cache** is UNCHECKED
5. Click **Redeploy**

**Option B: Via Git (Recommended)**
1. Commit the changes we just made:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add auth callback route and fix GradientBars imports"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Vercel will automatically deploy the new version

### Step 4: Test the Authentication Flow

Once deployed, test the complete flow:

1. **Sign Up Test:**
   - Go to your production site
   - Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
   - Enter your email and password
   - Submit the form

2. **Check Email:**
   - Open the confirmation email from Supabase
   - **Verify the link points to your production domain** (not localhost)

3. **Click Confirmation Link:**
   - Click the link in the email
   - You should be redirected to `/auth/callback`
   - Then automatically redirected to `/dashboard`
   - You should be logged in successfully

4. **Verify Dashboard Access:**
   - Check that you can see the dashboard
   - Try creating a plan to ensure everything works

## üîç How to Find Your Production URL

### If Using Vercel Default Domain:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Look for the **Domains** section
4. Copy the `.vercel.app` URL (e.g., `alira-git-main-username.vercel.app`)
5. Add `https://` prefix: `https://alira-git-main-username.vercel.app`

### If Using Custom Domain:
Use your custom domain with `https://` prefix

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build Still Failing

**Check:**
- Look at the build logs in Vercel
- Ensure all TypeScript errors are resolved
- Run `npm run build` locally to test

**Solution:**
The GradientBars fixes should resolve the build errors. If you still see issues, check for any other import errors.

### Issue: Email Links Still Point to Localhost

**Possible Causes:**
1. Environment variable not set correctly
2. Need to redeploy after setting environment variable
3. Cached build using old configuration

**Solution:**
1. Verify the environment variable is set in Vercel
2. Trigger a new deployment with cache disabled
3. Wait for the new deployment to complete
4. Test with a new signup (old emails will still have old links)

### Issue: "Authentication Required" Error After Clicking Email

**Possible Causes:**
1. Auth callback route not deployed
2. Redirect URLs not configured in Supabase
3. Session cookies not being set

**Solution:**
1. Ensure the new deployment is live
2. Check Supabase redirect URL configuration
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try in incognito mode to rule out cookie issues

### Issue: Redirected to Homepage Instead of Dashboard

**Possible Causes:**
1. Middleware blocking unauthenticated access
2. Session not being established properly

**Solution:**
1. Check that the auth callback route is setting cookies correctly
2. Check browser Network tab to see if session cookies are being set
3. Check middleware logs in Vercel

## üìù Technical Details

### What Changed

**File: `app/auth/callback/route.ts` (NEW)**
- Handles OAuth callback from Supabase
- Exchanges auth code for session
- Sets session cookies
- Redirects to dashboard

**Files: Import Fixes**
- `app/about/page.tsx`
- `app/contact/page.tsx`
- `app/services/page.tsx`
- `app/what-you-get/page.tsx`

Changed from:
```typescript
import GradientBars from '@/components/ui/gradient-bars'
```

To:
```typescript
import { GradientBars } from '@/components/ui/gradient-bars'
```

### How Email Confirmation Works Now

1. **User Signs Up** ‚Üí `lib/supabase-client.ts` calls Supabase with `emailRedirectTo`
2. **getURL() Function** ‚Üí Checks environment variables in this order:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (now set in Vercel) ‚úÖ
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL` (automatically set by Vercel)
   - Falls back to `localhost:3000` (only if neither is set)
3. **Supabase Sends Email** ‚Üí Link points to production domain
4. **User Clicks Link** ‚Üí Redirected to `/auth/callback` with auth code
5. **Callback Route** ‚Üí Exchanges code for session, sets cookies
6. **User Redirected** ‚Üí To `/dashboard` (logged in)

## ‚úÖ Success Checklist

- [ ] Environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is set in Vercel
- [ ] Supabase redirect URLs are configured
- [ ] Application has been redeployed
- [ ] Build completed successfully (no errors)
- [ ] Test signup sends email with correct production URL
- [ ] Clicking email link logs user in and redirects to dashboard

After completing these steps:

1. ‚úÖ Build will succeed (no more import errors)
2. ‚úÖ Email confirmation links will point to your production domain
3. ‚úÖ Users can complete signup and login successfully
